# Test files for parameterized processor tests
These test files are primarily intended for the parameterized processor test in
[ProcessorTest.java](../java/sorald/processor/ProcessorTest.java). Each file in
the subdirectories of this directory generates a single test case. See the
documentation in `ProcessorTest.java` for details on how to add a new
file/directory, or make a fun game of it and figure it out on your own :)
