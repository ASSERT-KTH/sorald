This repair targets classes that only have static members (_utility classes_)
and a public constructor, which they should not have according to the rule.
This repair only targets the case when there is an _implicit_ public
constructor, the so-called _default_ constructor, which is generated by the
compiler when no constructor is specified. The repair simply consists of adding
a private, no-args constructor at the top of the class.

```diff
 public class UtilityClassWithoutConstructor {
+    private UtilityClassWithoutConstructor() {
+    }
     public static final int SOME_CONSTANT = 42;
 }
```

> **Important:** The repair does not attempt to do anything if there is an
> explicit public constructor.
