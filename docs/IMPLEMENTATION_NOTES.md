## Implementation notes

The processors for the rules 1854, 1948, and 2095 are written in a different way from the others, using the Sonar web API for localising bugs.
The processors and their implementations have not been maintained and your milage may vary.
The remaining processors leverage the capabilities of Spoon for both localising and repairing violations.
