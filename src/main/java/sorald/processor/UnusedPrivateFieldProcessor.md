The repair consists of deleting unused `private` fields as it is considered as dead code.

Example:

```diff
 public class UnusedPrivateField {
-    private String a = "Hello world!";

     public int compute(int number) {
         return number * 42;
     }
 }
```

However, the `serialVersionUID` field, which must be `private`, `static`, `final`, and of type `long`, in Serializable
classes is not deleted because it is used during deserialization of byte stream.
